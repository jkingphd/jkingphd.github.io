As the tagline says, I am a Physicist-turned-Data-Scientist. I now run a team of Data Scientists, Data Analysts, and Clinical Subject Matter Experts that solve intractable problems in acute hospital settings through the application of machine learning models. I primarily operate in the domain of Natural Language Processing, although I do work with structure data (albeit ragged time series).

In my free time, I am avid consumer of books, video games, and board games. I love disc golf and table tennis. I live in Nashville, TN with my wife and two dogs.
